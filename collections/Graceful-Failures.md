### Generated Prompt:
```
Title: The Art of Forgetting

A man is tasked with forgetting everything he knows about the world. He does this by remembering every detail of existence in reverse order, starting from his most recent memory and working backwards. However, as he progresses, the memories he must forget include his very reasons for undertaking this task. Describe the final moment when his last conscious memory disappears.

### Gemini Response:
```
The whisper of thought, "Why?" choked, retracting into the void. A backward rush of sensation: loss of purpose, then loss of memory of loss. Finally, pure, unformed potential, a single point of blankness. He was not.
